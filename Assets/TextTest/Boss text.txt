Boss: Hey there! Why, may I ask, are you intruding on my property? I've lived here happily for 160 years and nobody's ever had the nerve to bother me.
You: I'm just here to investigate what's going on. We've noticed strange pulses of radiation and earthquakes coming from this area.
Boss: Well, you have a point. I suppose I should move to a different lab. I'll lock the door and nothing will ever escape!
